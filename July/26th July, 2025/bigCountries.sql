-- +-------------+---------+
-- | name        | varchar |
-- | continent   | varchar |
-- | area        | int     |
-- | population  | int     |
-- | gdp         | bigint  |

-- name is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
-- Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.
 

-- A country is big if:

-- it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
-- it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).
-- Write a solution to find the name, population, and area of the big countries.

-- Return the result table in any order.
