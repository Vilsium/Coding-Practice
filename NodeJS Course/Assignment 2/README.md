# Assignment 1 of NodeJS Course

### Tasks to perform

1. Create a `npm project` and install `Express.js` (Nodemon if you want to)

2. Create an Express.js app which funnels the request through 2 middleware functions that log something to the console and return one response

3. Handle request to `'/'` and `'/users'` such that each request only has one handler/middleware that does something with it (e.g. send dummy response)
